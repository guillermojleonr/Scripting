Google App Scripts (GAS) is a public repository where I publish some GAS code.

GAS is a javascript-like language to create macros and applications on the Google Workspace suite.

It works as a library with code you can reuse and implement in your projects.

This repository doesn't include all the GAS code nor GAS aplications I've developed.
